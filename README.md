## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh): Install Bun via the command line by running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

or

```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Or if you prefer, you can use other package managers like npm, yarn, or pnpm.

### Development

Copy the [`.env.sample`](.env.sample) file to `.env` to set up the environment variables. Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying [`src/app/(public)/page.tsx`](<src/app/(public)/page.tsx>). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Database

The Catalyst starter kit uses Prisma to interact with the database. By default, it uses PostgreSQL as the database engine.

To set up a local database for development, you can use Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command starts a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container and lets it run in the background.

You can find the database connection URL in the [`.env.sample`](.env.sample?plain=1#L38) file.

You can connect to the database with the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec database psql -U app_dev -d dev
```

Or, if you have `make` installed, you can use the following command:

```bash
make db
```

There is already a `User` model defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](prisma/schema.prisma). The correspondent migration file is located in [`prisma/migrations/`](prisma/migrations/). To create the database schema and generate the Prisma client, run:

```bash
bun run migrate
```

## Authentication

The Catalyst starter kit uses Auth.js for authentication. You can find the authentication logic in [`src/auth.ts`](src/auth.ts).

By default, a development secret is already set in the [`.env.sample`](.env.sample?plain=1#L26) file called `AUTH_SECRET`. Set this secret to a more secure random string at the hosting provider of your choice when deploying the application.

If you also need Google login, add your Google OAuth client ID and secret to the [`.env`](.env.sample?plain=1#L29) file.

GitHub login is also supported. Add your GitHub OAuth client ID and secret to the [`.env`](.env.sample?plain=1#L27) file.

All of these environment variables have placeholders if you copied the [`.env.sample`](.env.sample) file.

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. An example workflow is defined in [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml).
It installs the dependencies, lints the code, and builds the project.

## SEO

The project is configured to have a `robots.txt`, a `sitemap.xml`, and a `manifest.webmanifest` file. However, these files cannot be found directly in the repository. Instead, you can find TypeScript files with similar names in the [`src/app`](src/app) directory. Edit them to fit your app. These files use the [Metadata API from Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata).

Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORITY` environment variable in the [`.env`](.env.sample?plain=1#L5) file to the domain of your application. This variable is used in the `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` files.

It also sets various SEO-related tags in the root [`layout.tsx`](src/app/layout.tsx) file. Modify and extend these tags to fit your application's needs.

## Payments

The Catalyst starter kit uses Stripe for payment processing. The [`/api/stripe`](src/app/api/stripe/route.ts) endpoint is used to receive webhook events from Stripe. To enable this endpoint, set the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variables in the [`.env`](.env.sample?plain=1#L33) file.

In Stripe, set the webhook URL to `https://your-app-url/api/stripe`.

### Events

An example event handler is already set up for the `customer.subscription.updated` event. This event is triggered when a subscription is updated and is used in most subscription-based applications.

Configure the [endpoint](src/app/api/stripe/route.ts?plain=1#L26) to listen for the events you need. To to this, extend the logic of the `switch` statement with the cases for the events you want to handle.

### Billing Portal

For ease of use, we suggest not to reinvent the wheel and use the [Stripe Billing Portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management) to allow your users to manage their subscriptions. The Catalyst starter kit already has a helper function defined in [`src/lib/stripe.ts`](src/lib/stripe.ts?plain=1#L9) to create a session for the billing portal.

The helper function can only be used on the server side and ensures that the user is authenticated before creating the session. It has a single parameter: the Stripe `customerId` of the user.

As the example dashboard of Catalyst can be found at `/dashboard`, the return URL of the billing portal is `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` by default. You can change this to any URL by setting the `STRIPE_PORTAL_RETURN_URL` environment variable in the [`.env`](.env.sample?plain=1#L35) file.

## Logging

Catalyst uses Winston as the default logger and the default log level is `info`. You can change this by setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable in the [`.env`](.env.sample?plain=1#L22) file.

If you want to configure a log drain, set the `LOG_DRAIN_URL` environment variable in the [`.env`](.env.sample?plain=1#L23) file. This will send the logs to the specified URL as well as to the console.

## Analytics

Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` and/or `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER_ID` environment variables in the [`.env`](.env.sample?plain=1#L11) file to enable Google Analytics and/or Google Tag Manager.
